## Experiment 1: [Experiment Title Here]

### Purpose and Justification
Explain why this experiment was designed and how it relates to your critical success criteria.  
Clearly describe what question this experiment is trying to answer and what part of the system it validates.

### Detailed Procedure
Describe the step-by-step process of how this experiment was conducted.  
Include hardware setup, software configuration, testing conditions, and data collection methods.  
Ensure another team could replicate your work using only this description.

### Expected Results
State the hypothesis or expected outcomes **before** running the experiment.  
Include relevant equations, signal characteristics, or theoretical predictions.

### Actual Results
Present your collected data clearly.  
You can use:
- Tables (Markdown-formatted)
- Images (e.g., waveform screenshots)
- Graphs (linked from repo or plotted via code)

Example:

| **Test Condition** | **Measured Voltage (V)** | **Expected (V)** | **% Error** |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|:----------------:|:------------:|
| 5V Input | 4.96 | 5.00 | 0.8% |
| 3.3V Input | 3.28 | 3.30 | 0.6% |

### Interpretation and Conclusions
Interpret your results and discuss what they mean.  
- Did results meet your expectations?  
- Were there discrepancies?  
- How do these findings support (or challenge) your project’s success criteria?  
Include detailed reasoning supported by your data.

## Summary of Experimental Outcomes

Summarize the results of all experiments collectively.  
State whether your experiments **demonstrated that the project meets its original success criteria** as outlined in your conceptual design.  

If **success criteria were not met**, provide a clear explanation of why and what steps could be taken for improvement (e.g., design modification, component replacement, or calibration issues).

## Documenting and Tracking Components

Each team must maintain a complete and accurate record of all components acquired or assigned during the semester.  
This will be **strictly enforced** — component tracking is **not optional**.  
Failure to keep a complete and accurate inventory will result in **automatic failure** of the Experimental Analysis report.  

At the end of the semester, **all items must be accounted for** and **stations must be clean**.  
Missing items or incomplete records will be treated as a failure to meet critical project requirements.
