## Documenting and Tracking Components

Each team must maintain a complete and accurate record of all components acquired or assigned during the semester.  
This will be **strictly enforced** â€” component tracking is **not optional**.  
Failure to keep a complete and accurate inventory will result in **automatic failure** of the Experimental Analysis report.  

At the end of the semester, **all items must be accounted for** and **stations must be clean**.  
Missing items or incomplete records will be treated as a failure to meet critical project requirements.

### Final Inventory Check

At the end of the semester:
- All components listed above must be returned, properly stored, and accounted for.  
- Lab stations and storage boxes must be **clean and organized**.  
- Missing items or incomplete documentation will result in **automatic failure** of the Experimental Analysis report.
