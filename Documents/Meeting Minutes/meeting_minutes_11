# Meeting Minutes 11

## 14APR2025 1430-1600
Attendance: Brett Ballew, Tyler Bare, Mandy Bacon, Gabrielle Renfroe, & Erich Krepps

We continued our discussion on the power supply method, evaluating options to ensure both reliability and ease of 
installation (ultimately deciding against PoE). As always, we took time for team bonding. We also discussed the interaction 
between various system modules to ensure seamless integration. Additionally, we explored heat dissipation strategies within 
the chassis, including an evaluation of the additional power draw introduced by the heat sink fan and its impact on overall 
system performance.
