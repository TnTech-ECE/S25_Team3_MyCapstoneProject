# Meeting Minutes X
## 09APR2025 1500-1600
Attendance: Dr. Elfouly, Brett Ballew, Tyler Bare, Mandy Bacon, Gabrielle Renfroe, & Erich Krepps

The team met with our advisor this week to discuss our approach to capturing Remote ID (RID) signals from drones. During the meeting, 
we reviewed our current setup and strategy, focusing particularly on how we plan to detect and log the RID broadcast using our spectrum 
analyzer and Raspberry Pi 5. Our advisor provided valuable feedback on refining our signal acquisition process and suggested additional 
considerations for filtering out noise and identifying relevant frequency bands. To complement our technical discussion, we also used a 
mobile application capable of reading RID broadcasts to cross-reference and verify the data presented in the documentation packet we 
received. This hands-on verification helped us confirm that the expected signal characteristics align with those described in the 
packet and provided further confidence in the accuracy of our planned signal analysis approach.
