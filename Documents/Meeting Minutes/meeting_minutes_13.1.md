Attendance: Brett Ballew, Tyler Bare, Mandy Bacon, Erich Krepps, & Gabrielle Renfroe

* Basic database was created and a packet was sent to test functionality. 
* Additional work was done to reprogram the Pi. The program runs but all useful information shows as empty. 
* Meeting was scheduled with Dr. Elfouly. 

### Team Assignments:
* Brett: Get program to detect signal and return useful location data
* Mandy: Write script to send captured data to database. 
* Elle & Tyler: Continue work on the database
* Erich: Create a rough draft on website compatible with database; merge pull request from last semester

### Future Assignments:
* Get WiFi version to work, too :)
* Get wifi-signal detection code to compile on RPi5. 
* Test that the code is working by having it pick up the signal of the RID emitter and the Parrot drone. 
* Write a program to extract the useful RID information from the code (name, location). 
* Figure out how to distinguish drone wifi/bluetooth signals from other wifi/bluetooth signals. 
* Get password to previous website from Abe. 
* Update previous website or create our own to display information.

### Notes to All: 
Documentation is cool :0 <br>
Cheesy rollups = 180 cal
