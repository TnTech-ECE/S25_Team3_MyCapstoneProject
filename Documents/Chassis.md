## Function of the Subsystem
The chassis for the drone tracking device is the housing that will protect and organize all the other components that make up the device. It will hold the electrical components together in a compact and orderly fashion and keep them safe from dust, dirt, debris, water, and other foreign substances. Since the drone tracking system will be located outside, the chassis is a crucial component in both weather-proofing the system and keeping it cool. 

## Specifications and Constraints
1. The chassis shall be water resistant. It shall protect the internal electronics from water ingress due to rain storms, snow storms, water jets, and similar hazards. 
2. The chassis shall be dust and dirt resistant. It shall be designed to avoid dust buildup that could block vents or short-circuit components.
3. The chassis shall be external temperature resistant. It shall operate reliably in the wide range of temperatures typical of Tennessee weather and help ensure that the internal components operate reliably, as well. 
4. The chassis shall be shock resistant. It shall protect the internal components from damage due to drops, vibrations, or knocks. 
5. The chassis shall be wind resistant. It shall ensure that the device stays anchored or intact during strong gusts or extreme wind.
6. The chassis shall hold the entire device together. It shall keep all the internal and external components securely mounted and organized. 

## Overview of Proposed Solution
The chassis shall be a 3D printed structure specifically tailored to the needs of the drone tracking device. 

#### Key Design Choices

## Interface with Other Subsystems
The chassis shall integrate with the other atomic subsystems by securing and protecting the other hardware components. 
- Power Supply: Houses and secures the battery pack, ensuring stable power delivery.

Processing Unit: Provides mounting points and protection for the microcontroller or single-board computer.

Communication Modules: Accommodates antennas and transceivers, ensuring optimal signal transmission.

Sensors: Positions GPS, IMU, and other sensors for accurate data collection.
