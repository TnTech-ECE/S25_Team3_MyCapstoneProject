Why This Solution Works

Validation Approach
- Lab Testing:
- Environmental Stress Testing: 
- Longevity Testing: 


## Interface with Other Subsystems
Provide detailed information about the inputs, outputs, and data transferred to other subsystems. Ensure specificity and thoroughness, clarifying the method of communication and the nature of the data transmitted.


## 3D Model of Custom Mechanical Components


## Buildable Schematic 
Integrate a buildable electrical schematic directly into the document. If the diagram is unreadable or improperly scaled, the supervisor will deny approval. Divide the diagram into sections if the text and components seem too small.

The schematic should be relevant to the design and provide ample details necessary for constructing the model. It must be comprehensive so that someone, with no prior knowledge of the design, can easily understand it. Each related component's value and measurement should be clearly mentioned.


## Printed Circuit Board Layout
Include a manufacturable printed circuit board layout.

## BOM
