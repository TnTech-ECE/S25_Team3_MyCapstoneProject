## Introduction 

## The Fully Formulated Problem

Other than in a few special cases, the usage of unmanned aircraft systems on the Tennessee Technological University campus is not permitted according to university policies. Be that as it may, the campus police continue to receive complaints of drones causing security, safety, and privacy issues. Without a system in place to locate the offending devices, the officers face a great challenge of actually tracking down the drones and their users. In response to that challenge, this team has been tasked with creating an electronic sensing system to automatically detect these drones and alert the TTU campus police of their presence. Information about the illicit drones will be relayed to the police department via a private website, so that they can assess the threat to campus security and take whatever action they deem necessary. The drone tracking system will meet the specifications defined by the police department, while adhering to all constraints placed upon it by the existing standards for operation, the ethical responsibilities of engineers, and the potential broader impact of the system. The specifications and constraints for this drone tracking system are expounded below. 

### Drone Tracking System Specifications
#### In accordance with the expectations of the TTU campus police department, this project shall do the following: 
1. The system shall detect and track remote ID emitting drones flown over the contiguous TTU campus.
2. The system shall display the data in a concise manner to a secure website accessible only to campus police dispatchers. The campus police have specified that the database be accessed through a website, as opposed to an app, due to the security and privacy concerns that would be introduced were the officers to use their personal device on the job. The website will be accessible to the officers on scene and at the office.  
3. The system shall record and store critical data recovered from the Remote ID signal, until the data is uploaded to the website.
4. The system shall notify campus police in real-time upon detection of a drone in flight.  
5. The system shall enable campus police to grant and revoke drone authorizations as needed. The campus police have requested the ability to authorize specific drones via the website. If a drone user has permission to be operating the drone, such as a student filming a sporting event for the university’s social media page, the police will be able to easily confirm this on the website. The website will keep track of which drones are authorized and which are not.
6. The system shall be designed to minimize further maintenance.

#### Depending on time restraints and the preferences of the campus police, this project may also do the following: 
1. The system may determine the location of the drone’s user and upload this information to the website.
2. The system may increase the urgency of the alert if a drone is detected in a specific geographical region deemed of higher importance by the police department. 
3. The system may be extended to track drones over the Golden Eagle Golf Club and the Hyder-Burks Agriculture Pavilion.

### Drone Tracking System Constraints
The drone tracking system is primarily contrained by the legal standards of the United States of America, the State of Tennessee, and Tennessee Tech University. It is additionally constrained by the ethical and professional duties levied on all engineers in the process of designing a new product. The specific legal and moral obligations by which this project is constrained are examined in closer detail in the Ethical, Professional, and Standards Consideration section immediately below. 

## Ethical, Professional, and Standards Consideration
### Legal Standards
The drone tracking system must comply with all pertinent federal and state laws and with all applicable TTU policies. The way by which this team intends to adhere to each of these laws and policies is explained categorically here.

#### Standards regarding circuit design

#### Standards regarding data retention

### Ethical and Professional Responsibilities
The drone tracking system is intended to aid the Tennessee Tech police department in their mission to effectuate order and safety across campus. It is not intended to make students, faculty, staff, or any other person on the TTU campus feel as though their freedoms are being infringed upon. In the prevalent digital landscape of today, some people already feel as though they are under constant surveillance, and it is possible that with the implementation of this system, that feeling will be increased. However, by being enrolled at or employed by Tennessee Tech, students and employees consent to all university policies, including TTU Policy 190. This is the key university policy regarding drone usage, which says that all users "must comply with any local, state, and federal policies and standards." One such law is __________.

Whether or not the use of the drone in question is reckless and meriting suppression is ultimately decided by the dispatcher on the case, who must then determine the best and most professionally correct way to proceed. With all this taken into consideration, the engineering team believes that the creation of a device to simply alert the police of a drone's presence does not in itself create any serious ethical issues. The way by which the individual dispatchers will respond to these alerts is left to the discretion and ethical convictions of the Tech police department. 

### Broader Impact
